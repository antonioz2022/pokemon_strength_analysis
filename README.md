# 🧬 What Makes a Pokémon Strong? – Data Analysis Project

This project explores the Pokémon dataset to uncover what traits, stats, and types are most common among strong and legendary Pokémon. We use Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to perform the analysis and create visual insights.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Clean and understand the structure of the Pokémon dataset
- Explore base stats like HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.
- Analyze which types (`type1`) have the highest average stats
- Compare legendary vs. non-legendary Pokémon
- Visualize data through bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps
- Create a custom "Power Score" to rank Pokémon

---

## 🧪 Dataset

This project uses a Pokémon dataset with the following relevant columns:

- `name`: Pokémon name
- `type1`, `type2`: Primary and secondary types
- `hp`, `attack`, `defense`, `sp_attack`, `sp_defense`, `speed`: Base stats
- `base_total`: Sum of all base stats
- `is_legendary`: Whether the Pokémon is legendary (1) or not (0)
- `against_*`: Type effectiveness multipliers
- `weight_kg`, `height_m`, `generation`: Physical attributes and generation info

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📁 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `analysis.ipynb` using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter
3. Make sure to upload `pokemon.csv` to your working directory (if on Colab, use `files.upload()`)
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis

## 📌 Key Insights (to be filled later)

- 🔍 What types produce the strongest Pokémon?
- 🌟 How do legendary Pokémon differ from non-legendaries?
- 📈 What base stats correlate most with total strength?
